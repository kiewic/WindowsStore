WindowsStore
============

All incomplete Windows Store Apps are here:

TcpChat
-------

A two pages app. First page has a connect button. Second page has a text box, a 
button to send the content of the text box and a stack panel, to display 
received messages.

LyricsApp
---------

The PowerfulPage has a text block where the text that can grow or shrink using two 
pointers (fingers) or scroll up or down using one pointer. This is similar to a 
text block inside a scroll viewer with zoom enabled, but the difference is that
instead of reducing the width and height of the text block, this changes the
font size, allowing to use the same width (the screen width).

SensorsApp
----------

A bouncing ball. Include real gravity formulas :P

SwipeApp
--------

A square that can be accelerated and it is released, it will continue moving (inertia).

SuperOverflow
-------------

This contains an IXHR2 wrapper (incomplete).
